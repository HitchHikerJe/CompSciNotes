# CompSciNotes
notes from Ap CompSci
Alright, i know that the way that these files are uploaded is really funky, but i had to upload from a flashdrive and didnt want to go through the hassle of retyping every single file. Please look at the commit comments to find out what unit/part of compsci the file pertains to.
Cool? cool...
